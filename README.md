# Can-Crusher
Automatic aluminum can crusher using pneumatics and PLC control

The original inspiration for this project came from [here](https://youtu.be/DYM9kJFZgmg)

There were many comments in that video requesting a BOM and drawings but none were available.

There should be enough in this repository to get you started if you are interested to build your own including:

- [Link](https://a360.co/3pBXDni) to Autodesk Fusion 360 3D model - password: password
- BOM
- PLC code (you can see how to wire by reading input and output routines)


**Disclaimer**: 
I in no way certify this project to be any of the following:
- Inexpensive
- 100% safe
- Perfect

So if you decide to build it yourself, please take care and if you build one that is really cool or significatly less costly, let me know!
